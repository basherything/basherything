Sup! We are Bash Erything Group. We're made of a couple friends and university m8s that loves the pure bash scripting. Here you gonna find some repos,
scripts and automated work flows of variety subjects, included cybersec, offsec and defsec, network infra, and more!
Pls, I'll make it clear when I tell that we are students and deeply lovers of open source and bash: we're not professional yet and we're doing it
just for fun. Hope some of our sh help you of any way to achieving aknowleghment and let we know ur opinion of erything we upload here!
